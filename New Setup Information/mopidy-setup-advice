Setting Up Mopidy with ncmpcpp & Spotify

Install mopidy with spotify/streaming/local extensions - all else should be built in

Despite what the docs say, you can't use mopidy as a system service + ncmppcpp + spotify + pulseaudio. Trying to set mopidy's output device as a pulseaudio server sink will fail, since mopidy as a service launches before pulseaudio as a user service - and it doesn't have anything to connect to.

Furthermore, if you want to use it with Spotify, since the network driver loads as a system service as well, it's like mopidy will fail to connect to Spotify before the network loads. 

So place Mopidy on autolaunch when the user logs in somewhere, and it'll likely load at approximately the correct time. 

If you use mopidy as a service, autoaudiosink won't detect pulseaudio device changes - so it can't connect to bluetooth. 

This post has the info for setting it up with the visualiser, but I"m not touching that now
